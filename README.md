### Acknowledgements

Special thanks to [James Doyle](https://www.udemy.com/user/james-doyle-4/) for a great [tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/unityplatformer/). One of the hardest things when learning to create software in a new system is composing components together. This course is a great start at cracking this problem because James teaches us how to create player characters, enemies, levels, environmental hazards, a level select screen, a boss fight, a pause screen, and more.

Most importantly, James shows students how to compose these elements to create a complete game with reusable components like level templates (prefabs) all in about 15 hours. The course was a little long (ideal would be 5 - 10 hours) but was full of useful segments that were short so students can fix problems/debug quickly.

What would have pushed the course from a 4.5 to a 5 out of 5 stars is if there was a segment on character animations and projectiles that damage enemies or buff stats like invulnerability etc. I highly recommend the course.
